This document outlines best practices for developing React js application.


### Code Naming Conventions

- Component Names: Use Title Case (e.g., `FundList`)
- File Names: Use lowercase with dashes (e.g., `fund-list.tsx`)
- Enums: Use TitleCase (e.g., `FundCategory`)
- Queries: Noun for one, plural for many (e.g., `fund`, `stocks`)
- Mutations: Verb+Noun (e.g., `updatePortfolio`)


### Code Implementation Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety. prefer interfaces over types.
- When generating code, prioritize TypeScript best practices.
- Follow the coding standards defined in the ESLint configuration.
- Minimize the use of AI generated comments, instead use clearly named variables and functions.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer native functions over custom or Lodash's
- Use Lodash helpers instead of custom solutions
- Maintain consistency in naming and problem-solving
- Write indistinguishable, simple, and clean code
- Use modern (ES6) solutions, e.g. Object destructuring
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use Zod for form validation using schema validation and type inference.
- Use React Hook Form for form handling
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use common components for common UI elements like buttons, inputs, etc from Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind located in src/components/commons and src/components/ui.
- Use "import * as React from 'react'" for all react components.
- Define component as arrow function with React.FC<ComponentProps> or with React.FC.
- Dynamic imports: Use `React.lazy` to load components only when they are needed, improving initial load time. Example `const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('../components/MyComponent'))`. Do not overuse.
- Break down large components into smaller chunks that can be loaded independently.
- Before creating any custom common component always check Shadcn UI common components first.
- Avoid strings for properties in Lodash functions
- Prioritize clean code over performance unless necessary
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely needed
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
